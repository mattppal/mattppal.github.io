This page serves as my art log. I've been sketching semi-regularly in pen & ink since October, 2022. It's helped me through some rough times and made me enjoy flexing my creative muscle. I'm almost entirely self-taught, but I'm always looking for resources to grow and learn. I'm very gratefulâ€” both for the opportunity to express myself and to the **great people** in my life who have inspired me to pursue what's important.

As you'll see, I love flowers ðŸŒ»
