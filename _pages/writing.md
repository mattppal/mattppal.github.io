Outside of work, I enjoy exploring technical projects. Often, I find the best motivator is to work with other passionate individuals on ideas that have real-world applications. Here's a sample of my freelance/fun writing.

### Present

I'm currently collaborating with [Hex](https://hex.tech/) to share a look at the AllTrails analytics process and give insight into the usefulness of their product.

### Past
