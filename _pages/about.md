I'm a member of the {{site.author.team}} Team at {{site.author.company}}. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018, where I majored in physics & economics— I also played baseball. I currently reside in {{site.author.location}}.

I enjoy using analytics to improve understanding of product and tackling data engineering problems, specifically those around improving data access and efficiency. I'm also very passionate about product— I love making lives better by delivering value!
