I'm a member of the {{site.author.team}} Team at {{site.author.company}}. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018, where I majored in physics & economics— I also played baseball. I currently reside in {{site.author.location}}, but I've lived across the country, from the Smokies to the Uintas.

I enjoy using analytics to understand product and make data-driven decisions. I also find the engineering side fun— I love making things more efficient/building new tools. In my free time, I write and hack on fun projects, get outside, and do my best to become a better person.

This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Custom Ruby is used in a few spots to dynamically generate content. See [this post]({% post_url 2021-07-28-displaying-reading-list-in-real-time %}).
