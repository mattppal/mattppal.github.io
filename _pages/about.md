I'm a member of the {{site.author.team}} Team at {{site.author.company}}. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018, where I majored in physics & economics— I also played baseball. I currently reside in {{site.author.location}}.

I enjoy using analytics to understand product and make data-driven decisions. I also find the engineering side fun— I love making things more efficient/building new tools.
