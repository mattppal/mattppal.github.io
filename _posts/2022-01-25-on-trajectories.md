I frequently find myself worrying about the future. Will I find success? Achieve my goals? What is success? Do I have the right goals? I've done this since I was a kid, but the outcome is usually the same: I'll figure out what I want to do and work as hard as I can to make it happen. It's only in recent years that I've started to reconsider this approach.

I wouldn't say the approach works poorly. Throughout my life, through some combination of skill, hard work, and luck (a very, very large quantity of the latter), I've been able to achieve most things I set my mind to. I wouldn't say  I ended up where I planned, but at no point did I have a particular place I wanted to go. Instead, I set short-term goals and nearly killed myself trying to achieve them. Often, my mindset was, "I need to be working harder than anyone else to achieve what I'd like." Thankfully, my short-term goals laddered up to some nice long-term outcomes, but this was no means by design.

I think there are some deep-rooted personal beliefs behind my resolution:

1. I am not like everyone else therefore I need to do things differently.
2. To prove I'm not mediocre, I need to work as hard as possible.
3. The things I want to accomplish necessitate maximal effort daily.

Upon reflection, all three of those are flawed.

1. What other people are doing is irrelevant, the only thing important is the _truth_.
2. Perhaps, but hard work is only effective when applied intelligently.
3. Unequivocally falseâ€” _most things_ can be accomplished through planning and small actions taken daily.

The remainder of this post will focus on the second point. A resounding lesson from the past two years has been that trajectory is foundational to reaching a goal. It's not _more important_ than hard workâ€” one couldn't look at the Eiffel Tower and say any steel beam is more important than another, yet those at the top couldn't be there without the beams at the bottom.

Like layers of steel on a great tower, trajectory lays the foundation for hard work. Together, the outcome is beautiful.

It's human to focus on the day-to-day, to live in the moment. Yet, even for the well intentioned, this can lead to a myopic focus on the day, week, or month. Without time to step back and reflect, taking life day-by-day won't affect long-term change (for most). Our lives are comprised of years & decades, and _true_ foundational change occurs on those timescales.

The only way to affect true change is to head in the right direction. Consider two busses going from New York to Los Angeles. One bus can go 50% faster than the otherâ€” which will arrive first?

It might seem like an easy answer, but speed and execution are two very different things: more important than the bus is the _bus driver_. If bus #1 takes off in a rush and ends up in Miami, while bus #2 carefully plots out his route before setting off, who will reach their goal on-time?

The analogy has obvious carryover to personal goals, with a few caveats: none of us know our (final) destination and we're not racing against anyone. What we _can_ do is set interim personal goals that take us a step closer to _who we want to be_ at the end of the day. Of course, that requires us to know who we want to be. ðŸ˜‰

The traits that result in us meeting our destination in as efficient a manner as possible are:

1. Figuring out where we want to go.
2. Charting out a plan to get there, which might take a _very_ long time.
3. Adjusting for challenges en-route.
4. _Pacing ourselves_
5. Being consistent, showing up _every day_.
6. Getting help where necessary, **especially if it's on direction**.

Hence, I'm now inclined to believe that it's the path we take to reach our goals that has the most foundational importance. Without a solid _trajectory_ or any _consistency_ hard work is misguided, ineffective, and unproductive.

Not only that, but the trajectory we choose matters! What's worse than working towards a goal you don't care about?

How often do we ask ourselves "If I continue on this path, where will I be in a year, five, ten?" Often, this is difficult because it requires introspection and _truth_. Do I really want to confront my fears, sorrows, regrets? Do I want to acknowledge the facts of my life and the consequences of my decisions?

This was the origin of the worries I had as a child and those ones that still haunt me today. I wake up each day and worry that in 5 years I will be insufficient & mediocre. There is nothing more frightening to me that being in the same place I am now.

I've spent so much time avoiding the truth and facts of reality. By confronting them and recognizing _what I want_, I can remove a huge barrier to my goals. Setting small milestones allows me to have some **sense of direction** for where I'm headed and, hopefully, takes me somewhere I'm proud to be. There is no finish line in life, no leaderboard for success. The nebulosity makes it all the more difficult to stay on-track, which speaks to the necessity for internal motivators.

Hard work is meaningless with out a trajectory. A trajectory can be misguided without the truth. An accurate perception of reality is necessary to tell ourselves the truth. The ability to decipher reality is the most valuable skill one can have.
