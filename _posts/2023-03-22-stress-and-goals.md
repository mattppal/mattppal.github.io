## Intro

I've written about the importance of trajectory in achieving goalsâ€” it's a foundational concept that _limits_ the upper bound of achievement. If you're headed in the wrong direction, it's unlikely that you'll ever arrive at your destination. This is a relatively obvious conclusion and makes the importance of a solid trajectory self-evident. 

More opaque are the concepts of self-compassion and stress management. Are they really necessary? Why should I be kind to myself? 

## Self-compassion

For the longest time, my logic went "I'm kind to other people and I hold myself to a high standard. Therefore, it's OK to be hard on myself." Explicitly, I was making a concession to beat myself down when I did not succeed. This is unfortunate, because I fail quite oftenâ€” to achieve personal goals, to reach milestones, in my everyday efforts, etc. 

My own beliefs were causing _additional_ stress when I failed. Not from bosses, teammates, partners, but from myself. I was opening myself up to the [second arrow](https://grandrapidstherapygroup.com/second-arrow-of-suffering/#:~:text=The%20parable%20of%20the%20second,arrow%20is%20even%20more%20painful.). The parable of the second arrow is a Buddhist concept on suffering. When we suffer, two arrows are sent our way. The first is the painful event itself, the second has to do with our thoughts. Frequently, the first arrow _is not_ the most painfulâ€” it's how we handle it (the second) that can be deadly.

But why am I upset by failure? Because I want to be great.

I fail so oftenâ€” to achieve personal goals, to reach milestones, in my everyday efforts, etc. that it can be difficult to handle. It's so easy to get discouraged by repeated, failed efforts, but it's essential to remember that failing is the result of pushing boundaries. Easy tasks, by definition, will have a high success rate. It's only when we try truly hard things that we fail... and subsequently grow. Of course, this doesn't mean attempt unreasonable things for the sake of failing, but rather that missing the mark is a part of the process.

The more I fail and learn, the more I see that it's a part of life. Achieving hard goals is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be many "downs", but they make the "ups" all the more worthwhile. I'm starting to learn that _accepting_ failure and moving-on is key. By dodging the second arrow, the first only slows me down a bit. Progress is then about taking failure in stride and not allowing it to derail you from your long-term goals.

## Stress Management

Closely linked to self-compassion is stress management. It's not hard to see that if you're getting dinged by arrows all the time, you're probably pretty stressed out. Especially if 50% of those arrows are the consequence of your own thinking (in my case it's more like a 1:4 situation ðŸ˜‚). I've always felt the effects of stress, but it's rare for me to be so glaringly aware of it.

In the past few weeks, my mind and body quit on me. 

In hindsight, this was a natural consequence of my actions. Pushing myself physically, mentally, and emotionally, without a respite, for months/years on end finally took it's toll. The funny thing? I didn't even suffer _truly_ acute stressors. I work a comfortable job with great job security, I get to see my friends and family often, I had the beginnings of a good relationship, and I live in a beautiful part of the country.

Unfortunately, I subjected myself to an inordinate amount of chronic stress. Combined with the arrows I've been dealing, it was too much. I learned the hard way:

- I woke up several days wanting to do precisely nothing. For someone of my disposition, that's extremely alarming and foreign.
- I felt extremely tired and fell ill.
- I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours each night.
- I saw my training (weightlifting) suffer. Relatively light loads were a struggle.
- I suffered mood swings and extremely intense emotional reactions. I found it much harder to control my thoughts and feelings.
- My appearance changed. I had deep bags under my eyes and retained water. My weight increased 5lb over the course of a week without changing my diet (likely water retention/poor digestion.)

This all led to a decrease in confidence and a cycle of negative thought, further accelerating my spiral. 

The point? Self-compassion and stress management are inexorably linked. To be kind to yourself is to forgo stress. It's to recognize unhelpful patterns. It's detachment, acceptance, and contentment. These are very easy things to say and even now I don't _truly_ believe some of them, but I'm working towards a much kinder mindset.

I've stepped back from a number of my goals in the short-term to clean-up a few things that have been sitting in my head. It's a "one step back, two steps forward" approach that can be hard to swallow for someone like me.
